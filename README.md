# Boston Map that shows the bus stops on campus
Description: this is the project I did where I pulled boston google map, and placed the bus stops on the MIT campus with markers. I also added in animation to show the movement of the bus.
This is where the repo is: https://github.com/nicolenanwu/nicolenanwumap.github.io

How to run:
1. Go to the html file here: https://nicolenanwu.github.io/nicolenanwumap.github.io/map.html
2. Click the button where it says "show bus stop between MIT and Harvard", then you will see the bus rotating between stations.

Next to improved:
I will use similar method to pull a map for where I'm located (Seattle). And I can create event maps in Seattle to guide the attendees.
