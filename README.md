# Boston Map that shows the bus stops on campus
## this is the project I did where I pulled boston google map, and placed the bus stops on the MIT campus with markers. I also added in animation to show the movement of the bus.
How to run:
Click the button where it says "show bus stop between MIT and Harvard", then you will see the bus rotating between stations.
How to improved:
I will use similar method to pull a map for where I'm located (Seattle). And I can create event maps in Seattle to guide the attendees.
